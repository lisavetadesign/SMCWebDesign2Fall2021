                    <b>When and how did you first get involved with ACPB? </b>
                    <br>
                    I first got involved with ACPB by fostering dogs in 2014. I then joined the core team as a foster
                    coordinator in 2015.
                    <br>
                    <b>What do you do as an ACPB volunteer?</b>
                    <br>
                    As a volunteer, I help out wherever I can for the dogs! I attend pack hikes, adoption events,
                    training classes, care for the dogs at Jefferson Park, and chauffer the dogs around town. As a
                    foster coordinator, I help get dogs settled into foster homes and offer support to families as they
                    care for their foster dogs and help prepare them for adoption.
                    <br>
                    <b>What has been the best part of fostering? The most challenging?</b>
                    <br>
                    Including my current foster dog (Buddy) I have fostered 127 dogs! The best part of fostering is
                    getting to know each dog as an individual; they all have such different personalities and after each
                    one is adopted I get a new one! The most challenging part of fostering is the occasional urgent bath
                    and clean up when a dog isn't feeling well and gets diarrhea.
                    <br>
                    <b>What's been the best part of volunteering? The most challenging?</b>
                    <br>
                    Being able to help lots of different dogs in the program and seeing them all get adopted into loving
                    homes is the best part of volunteering with ACPB. The most challenging? Keeping track of all the
                    dogs! I try to meet all of the dogs at Jefferson Park before they move into foster homes so it's
                    easier to remember each name and face.
                    <br>
                    <b>What would you say to someone who's on the fence about fostering a dog?</b>
                    <br>
                    Start slow--you can foster a dog temporarily, for a weekend or even just 1 night and see how it
                    goes!
                    <br>
                    <b>What do you think makes someone a good foster parent to a dog?</b>
                    <br>
                    A good foster parent is anyone who is willing to meet each dog where they are. Every dog will have
                    different needs. Whether it's potty training, leash work, socialization, or just giving them a quiet
                    home to decompress from the stress of a shelter environment, foster parents play a crucial role in
                    preparing dogs for adoption.
