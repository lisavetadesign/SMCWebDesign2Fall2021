                    <h2>HALLOWEEN</h2>
                    Today's Halloween customs are thought to have been influenced by folk customs and beliefs from the
                    Celtic-speaking countries, some of which are believed to have pagan roots. Jack Santino, a
                    folklorist, writes that "there was throughout Ireland an uneasy truce existing between customs and
                    beliefs associated with Christianity and those associated with religions that were Irish before
                    Christianity arrived". Historian Nicholas Rogers, exploring the origins of Halloween, notes that
                    while "some folklorists have detected its origins in the Roman feast of Pomona, the goddess of
                    fruits and seeds, or in the festival of the dead called Parentalia, it is more typically linked to
                    the Celtic festival of Samhain, which comes from the Old Irish for 'summer's end'."

                    Samhain was the first and most important of the four quarter days in the medieval Gaelic calendar
                    and was celebrated on 31 October – 1 November in Ireland, Scotland and the Isle of Man.
                    A kindred festival was held at the same time of year by the Brittonic Celts, called Calan Gaeaf in
                    Wales, Kalan Gwav in Cornwall and Kalan Goañv in Brittany; a name meaning "first day of winter". For
                    the Celts, the day ended and began at sunset; thus the festival began on the evening before 7
                    November by modern reckoning (the half point between equinox and solstice). Samhain is mentioned
                    in some of the earliest Irish literature. The names have been used by historians to refer to Celtic
                    Halloween customs up until the 19th century, and are still the Gaelic and Welsh names for
                    Halloween
