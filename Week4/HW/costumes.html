                <h2>HALLOWEEN COSTUMES</h2>
                Halloween costumes are traditionally modeled after supernatural figures such as vampires, monsters,
                ghosts, skeletons, witches, and devils. Over time, the costume selection extended to include popular
                characters from fiction, celebrities, and generic archetypes such as ninjas and princesses.

                Dressing up in costumes and going "guising" was prevalent in Scotland and Ireland at Halloween by the
                late 19th century. A Scottish term, the tradition is called "guising" because of the disguises or
                costumes worn by the children. In Ireland the masks are known as 'false faces'. Costuming
                became popular for Halloween parties in the US in the early 20th century, as often for adults as for
                children, and when trick-or-treating was becoming popular in Canada and the US in the 1920s and
                1930s.

                Eddie J. Smith, in his book Halloween, Hallowed is Thy Name, offers a religious perspective to the
                wearing of costumes on All Hallows' Eve, suggesting that by dressing up as creatures "who at one time
                caused us to fear and tremble", people are able to poke fun at Satan "whose kingdom has been plundered
                by our Saviour". Images of skeletons and the dead are traditional decorations used as memento
                mori.
